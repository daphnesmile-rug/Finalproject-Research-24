# My Project

## General Information
This project analyzes the variation in average sentence length between the novels of Jane Austen and Arthur Conan Doyle. The focus of the project is how sentence structures reflect the different approaches to storytelling. The main goal of this research paper is to compare how the average sentence length varies between the authors and understand how this influences their writing styles and affects different audiences.

## Background Information
Sentence length is a meaningful linguistic feature that helps understand how writing styles evolve over time and reflect cultural and literary norms. It provides insight into how sentence length affects different audiences, influencing readability, the reader's perception, and appreciation for literary works. Studies have demonstrated the importance of sentence length in stylistic analysis. For example in research of Muchnik, M. (2002) the sentence length is proved to be a indicator of narrative style and pace, by examining sentece length in two novellas. Sentence length can differ significantly between works, which influences how readers experience and interpret the written text. In the research of Matthews, N., & Folivi, F. (2023) it is determined that shorter sentences improve readability and provide increasing accessibility and inclusion, which is also seen in fields such as public health communication. The findings highlight the importance of sentence length as a factor in determining how audiences process written material.

## Research Question and Hypotheses
Does sentence length reflect the different narrative and storytelling styles of Jane Austen and Arthur Conan Doyle?

Jane Austen's novels will contain longer sentences compared to Arthur Conan Doyle's novels. This will reflect the more elaborate and descriptive writing style of Austin, containing descriptive characters' thoughts, development, and social dynamics. To convey these details she uses longer, more elaborate and more complex descriptions, which will increase the length of the sentences. Doyle's style is designed for fast-readable detective stories, consisting of shorter, straightforward sentences that keep action and the plot clear. Therefore, Austen's elaborate style will lead to longer sentences, while Doyle's action-focused writing is more concise and to the point.

## Method
**Dataset**
The dataset will include two novels from the authors, Jane Austin and Arthur Conan Doyle, which are retrieved from Project Gutenberg, a online archive of public domain texts.
The novels are:
Jane Austin:
    Sense and Sensibility (1811)
    Pride and Prejudice (1813)
Arthur Conan Doyle: 
    The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes (1892)
    The Hound of the Baskervilles (1902)
**Sampling Method**
For sampling, sentences will be extracted from the text using a Python3 script, then words will be counted. Sentences are defined as text strings ending with punctuation marks, such as '.', '!' or '?'. Sentences between apostrophes ("") will not be considered as a separate sentence. Words are defined as text strings in sentences delimeted by spaces: " ".
The size of the sample will be a random sampling of 1000 sentences of each novel.
**Analysis Plan**
Python3 will be used for text processing, the extraction of senteces and words and the counting of the words.
